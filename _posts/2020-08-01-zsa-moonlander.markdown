description: an ergonomic mechanical keyboard
categories: links

spotted this on Twitter via a Hacker News link. i've been eyeing ergonomic keyboards for a little
bit now because i've almost destroyed my wrists and elbows from typing too much. the design reminds
me a lot of the ErgoDox, which makes sense since this is apparently made by the same people who
manufacture the ErgoDox EZ.

probably won't buy one for right now, since i don't want to spend that much money on something until
i have a job again, but this can go alongside the [Ultimate Hacking Keyboard] in terms of "fancy
keyboards to consider when i have disposable income again".
