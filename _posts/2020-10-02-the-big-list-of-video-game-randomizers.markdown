I find the concept of video game randomizers very interesting. I first came across them in the idea
of [randomizers for Pokémon][pokemon-randomizer], which ran rearrange which pokémon appear in which
areas, to create a different experience from the same formula. [Variations on this
theme][key-item-rando] have appeared which shuffle around "key items", used to track progress
through the game, so that you have to traverse the world in an unintended way to be able to complete
it. Randomizers like this are popular in the Pokémon speedrunning community, to create a fresh
experience out of games they've played over and over.

I've only seen this concept in action for one other game (Final Fantasy on the NES), but apparently
this concept is rather widespread. Scrolling down the list of games that are featured here, it's
interesting to think what new experiences could be made out of old favorites.
