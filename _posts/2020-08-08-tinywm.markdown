i asked on twitter/mastodon about how people write window managers for Linux, and got a lot of links
in response. someone linked me to this project, which is 50 lines of C code that links against Xlib
to make what is probably the absolute minimum a window manager can be. the site also has a
heavily-commented version that actually describes what's going on.
